"""Static guards for the layering docs/CODEBASE.md §1 states.

Three invariants, all checked by parsing the source — no model load, no GPU
(and, alongside them, one file-scoped guard: `analysis/sequences.py` imports
nothing from `causalab.neural` at any scope — see `SEQUENCES_FILE`):

1. **`io/` has no upward imports.** It is the lowest application layer above
   third-party libs, and the layers above it consume it, so an upward edge
   would be a cycle.
2. **Shipped step scripts are torch-free at module level.** Numerics belong
   inside a script's ``main``, so hashing one costs nothing but stdlib. The
   runner already uses the same idiom for pandas and matplotlib.
3. **`protocol/` keeps no module-level edge to the workflow layer.** That is
   what makes the intervention protocol usable on its own; dispatch between
   document types lives in `causalab/cli.py`, above both packages. `io/` is
   *not* forbidden to it: docs/CODEBASE.md §1 calls `io/` the lowest application
   layer, and the environment a document is
   loaded against (`io/env.py`), the readers a compile reads with
   (`io/sources.py`) and the metric-table format (`io/tables.py`) live there
   as the protocol's inputs by design. What that costs is guarded the other
   way round: those three modules stay torch-free at module level, so the
   protocol's dependency on them never drags numerics into `validate`.
   (`io/results_io.py` is outside that guard on purpose: nothing in
   `protocol/` imports it.) `protocol/__init__.py` is lazy (PEP 562) so that
   those three modules can import protocol modules at module level without a
   cycle.

Invariant 2 is a *static* check. Its behavioural counterpart — that a real
``causalab validate`` of a script workflow leaves torch out of ``sys.modules``
— lives in ``tests/protocol/test_load_is_torch_free.py``, because
``tests/conftest.py`` imports torch at session scope and an in-process check
could never see the difference.
